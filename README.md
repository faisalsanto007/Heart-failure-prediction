# Heart-failure-prediction
This is a beginner level project. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).

performed data pre-processing then did some exploratory data analysis to see which features are more related to heart failure. there were outliers in the dataset but we removed them. finally trained our model and and got our accuracy score. model accuracy is around 75% which is not that good. but the dataset is a bit small. but still we could've improved the accuracy more by performing cross validation.
